# Quick Intro

- 👋 Hi, I’m Miriam, from Australia
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a job in IT. Software engineering or cybersecurity are my main areas of interest. But I am also happy to work on open source projects and generally help out in any way I can
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at La Trobe University, but my degree hasn't been my first foray into programming which actually began in QBASIC - that was a while ago!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you may want some new eyes on. The language I am most comfortable in currently is Python, but I started out programming in C++ and am learning Java in my degree so I am also capable in some C style languages. I did do a course in web dev so can handle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (although making websites with pretty designs is not one of my strengths! I'm better at problem solving and logic than eye-catching designs). SQL and databases is something I am learning currently.

## My purpose in writing this

I understand the world of IT is huge. My main desire is just to help. If you're starting out and want to collaborate, or want eyes on something you've done, I would be happy to look. If you're not a beginner, but are trying to get a project up and running, don't have enough people and think I could be of some use, shoot me an email and maybe I can!

There are projects I have completed or are working on in most of the aforementioned languages (Python, Java, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript) in my repositories. Feel free to have a peek.
