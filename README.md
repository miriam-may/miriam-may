# Quick Intro

- 👋 Hi, I’m Miriam, from Australia
- 👀 Software engineering or cybersecurity are my main areas of interest. But I am also happy to work on open source projects and generally help out in any way I can
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at La Trobe University, but my degree hasn't been my first foray into programming which actually began in QBASIC - that was a while ago!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you may want some new eyes on. The language I am most comfortable in currently is Python, but I started out programming in C++ and am learning Java in my degree so I am also capable in some C style languages. I did do a course in web dev so can handle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (although making websites with pretty designs is not one of my strengths! I'm better at problem solving and logic than eye-catching designs). SQL and databases is something I am learning currently.

## Additional

There are projects I have completed or are working on in most of the aforementioned languages (Python, Java, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript) in my repositories. Feel free to have a peek.
